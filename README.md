Sentiment Analysis on the IMDB Movie Review Dataset Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with Hyperparameter Optimization:
     In this project, we utilize the IMDB Movie Review dataset-a collection of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a review.

     Dataset Description:
The IMDB Movie Review Dataset is a large collection of 50,000 movie reviews, each labeled with a sentiment (either positive or negative). This dataset is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) for tasks like sentiment analysis, where the goal is to classify the overall sentiment expressed in a text. Each review is a free-form text entry, and the sentiments are typically represented in binary form, with 1 for positive reviews and 0 for negative reviews.
